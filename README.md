Three years ago, I created my Fiverr profile with a simple goal: **deliver honest, high‑quality mobile apps and earn trust—one client at a time**.

I started small:

* Late nights fixing bugs 
* Learning from rejections 
* Over‑delivering on every single order 

Slowly, things changed.

Clients started returning. Reviews started stacking. Referrals followed.

What truly worked was **consistency, communication, and treating every project like my own product**.

Today:

* ⭐ **Top Rated Mobile App Developer on Fiverr**
* 🏆 **Top 1% Talent on Fiverr worldwide**
* 💼 **50+ successful mobile apps delivered**
* 🌍 Clients across **USA, UK, EU, Middle East & Asia**

This journey taught me one thing:

> *Skills matter — but reliability and effort build careers.*

## 🌄 Beyond Code (Personal Side)

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:

* 🥾 Hiking in nature
* 🏕 Camping & outdoor exploring
* ✈️ Traveling and discovering new places
* 🏋️ Training at the gym to stay disciplined

These habits keep me focused, consistent, and mentally sharp — the same mindset I bring to my work.
